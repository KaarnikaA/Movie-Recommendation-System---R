# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains the code for a movie recommendation system built using Python. The system utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies to users based on their past viewing history.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Preprocessing:** 
    * Loads and cleans movie and user rating data.
    * Performs data transformation and normalization.
    * Handles missing values and sparsity in the rating matrix.
* **Collaborative Filtering:**
    * Implements user-based collaborative filtering.
    * Calculates user similarities using appropriate metrics (e.g., cosine similarity).
    * Generates personalized movie recommendations based on user similarities.
* **Model Evaluation:**
    * Evaluates the performance of the recommendation system using appropriate metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score).
* **API Integration (Optional):**
    * Includes an API endpoint (using libraries like Flask or FastAPI) to provide real-time movie recommendations.

**Technologies Used:**

* **Python:** Primary programming language.
* **Pandas, NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical operations.
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing.
